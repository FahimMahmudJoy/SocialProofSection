# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). 

### My Approach
Plain HTML and CSS Flexbox

### What I learned
I tried to use modifier classes alongside generic classes to align the individual rating and review.

### Difficulties
Faced some problems while trying to align the individual review as per the design. However, I did a little calculation and adjusted the top and bottom margin for each of the review to get them in place.
I couldn't reduce the image size though and not sure why it didn't work.
